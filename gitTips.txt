Initializes the local repo
ensure the remote repo is created
use git init // in the folder containing the files you're merging the GitHub repo
use git add FILENAME // to add the desired files
use git commit -m “COMMENTS HERE” // to insert you comments about the change / commit
use git push —set-upstream GITREPRO_HTTPS_ADDRESS master // copy this from your address bar of your web browser
now use git push to push all of the files and commit comments.

*If you leave your session you may need to perform the --set-upstream again to reestablish your GitHub repo as the remote master

If a flag is raised about there being unrelated histories use:

	git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
